The data visualization tool provides a quick and easy way to visualize and compare time-series data. The visualizations provide insight into how different hotel rooms compare, deviations of room temperature from setpoint temperature, data distribution, correlations between sensory data parameters, and the degree of correlation of room temperature compared to other parameters. The application is aimed at a wide range of users, from lay people and hotel staff to data analysts and scientists conducting research in this area.

Application dashboards are divided into two web pages: (1) detailed analysis of one hotel room, and (2) comparison of two selected hotel rooms. The corresponding pages are shown below:
