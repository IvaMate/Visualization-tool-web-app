The data visualization tool offers a convenient solution for visualizing and comparing time-series data swiftly. It furnishes insights into various aspects including comparisons between different hotel rooms, temperature variations from the setpoint, data distribution, correlations among sensory parameters, and the correlation degree of room temperature with other parameters. Designed for a broad spectrum of users ranging from laypeople and hotel staff to data analysts and researchers, the application aims to facilitate understanding and analysis in this domain.

The web application was developed by utilizing the Dash framework, which is uses Flask and React.js. Leveraging the Dash framework and associated packages like Plotly, the visualization tool was constructed entirely in the Python programming language.

Application dashboards are divided into two web pages: (1) detailed analysis of one hotel room, and (2) comparison of two selected hotel rooms. The corresponding pages are shown below:

- First page visualizations: 
(a) Line graph
(b) Parallel coordinates chart 
(c) Matrix chart 
(d) 2D histogram chart
